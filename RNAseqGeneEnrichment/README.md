# RNAseqGeneEnrichment
Liver RNA-sequencing data generated by Cole et al. (Accession Number GSE89272) previously deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), an NCBI public repository associated  with the National Institute of Healthâ€™s Sequence Read Archive (SRA), was wrangled and analyzed.

Data analyses included:
Hierarchical clustsering;
Multidimensional Scaling;
Differential expression analyses between genotype at 2months and 22months of age;
Functional enrichment analyses for Gene Ontology (GO) terms for biological processes;
Functional enrichment analyses for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathways;
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for both GO terms and KEGG pathways.
